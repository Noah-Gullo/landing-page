## Description:
Second project of The Odin Project. This project shows a basic static landing page that has a few images, a header/footer, and a bunch of information with styling and formatting.

## Skills:
This project was a great practice of using CSS to style my project to make it look a look cleaner along with Flexbox to position the elements and have them scale as the viewport size changes. This was a great way to bring together all of the CSS and Flexbox I have learned.

## Reflection:
I did not perfectly match the goal layout, but I'm proud of all of the progress that I have made. It's really cool being able to style a webpage the way that I want it to look and I definitely see the progress. I am excited to see what i learn next!
